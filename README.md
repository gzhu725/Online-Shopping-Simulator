# Online-Shopping-Simulator

This program simulates shopping online. It includes exception handling as well as File I/O which records a customer's name, address, and credit card information. For the buffered writer, if you would like your own ".txt" file, please create a folder, find the path file and create a ".txt" file inside. 

The Credit Card validator was based off a video (see comment on line 97 for reference).
